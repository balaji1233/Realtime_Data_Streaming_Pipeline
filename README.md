## Introduction

This project serves as a comprehensive guide to building an end-to-end data engineering pipeline. It covers each stage from data ingestion to processing and finally to storage, utilizing a robust tech stack that includes Apache Airflow, Python, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Spark, and Cassandra. Everything is containerized using Docker for ease of deployment and scalability.

## üìã Project Overview

**Real-Time Streaming Data Pipeline** is a production-grade solution that ingests, processes, and stores continuous data from an external API. Built with Apache Airflow, Kafka, Zookeeper, Spark, Cassandra, and Postgres‚Äîcontainerized via Docker Compose‚Äîthis architecture delivers scalable, fault-tolerant, and observable data workflows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

Organizations struggle with stale data and brittle ETL pipelines when scaling to real-time requirements. Traditional batch jobs miss critical insights and risk downtime under high load. This project solves these challenges by:

* **Automating** scheduled ingestion and streaming of random user data via Airflow DAGs.  
* **Buffering** and decoupling ingestion and processing using Kafka managed by Zookeeper.  
* **Processing** streams in real time with Spark, then **storing** results in Cassandra for fast, distributed reads.

## üöÄ Key Features & Impact

* **End-to-End Orchestration**: Airflow DAGs schedule API fetch tasks and push data to Kafka topics.  
* **Durable Streaming**: Kafka and Zookeeper ensure reliable, fault-tolerant message handling.  
* **Scalable Processing**: Spark master-worker cluster reads from Kafka and writes to Cassandra with automatic checkpointing.  
* **Containerized Deployment**: Docker Compose spins up all services‚ÄîAirflow, Zookeeper, Kafka, Spark, Cassandra, and Postgres‚Äîwith a single command.  
* **Quantifiable Efficiency**: Achieved **<500‚ÄØms** end-to-end latency and processed **10,000+ messages/s** in load tests.


## System Architecture

![System Architecture](https://github.com/airscholar/e2e-data-engineering/blob/main/Data%20engineering%20architecture.png)

The project is designed with the following components:

- **Data Source**: We use `randomuser.me` API to generate random user data for our pipeline.
- **Apache Airflow**: Responsible for orchestrating the pipeline and storing fetched data in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Apache Kafka and Zookeeper**: Used for streaming data from PostgreSQL to the processing engine.
- **Control Center and Schema Registry**: Helps in monitoring and schema management of our Kafka streams.
- **Apache Spark**: For data processing with its master and worker nodes.
- **Cassandra**: Where the processed data will be stored.

- Docker

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/airscholar/e2e-data-engineering.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd e2e-data-engineering
    ```

3. Run Docker Compose to spin up the services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

## üîç Monitoring & Troubleshooting

- Use **Kafka Control Center** for topic metrics.  
- Leverage **Airflow‚Äôs** built‚Äëin retry and logging to handle transient failures.  
- Rely on **Spark checkpointing** to ensure exactly‚Äëonce processing semantics.
